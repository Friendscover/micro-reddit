# Micro-Reddit

This was just a test project to learn and apply the model associations in Rails (has_many, belongs_to).
Before starting it was recommended to visualize the DB Relations on paper. This way the project was easier to solve and it helped me assign the right relations to the corresponding tables.
Even though it is just a test without any interface for the user, I learned a ton of stuff doing it.

Check it out in the Rails console
```
rails c 
```
